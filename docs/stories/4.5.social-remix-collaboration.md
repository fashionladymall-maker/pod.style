# Story 4.5: Remix Attribution & Collaboration Flow

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** creator remixing existing designs,
**I want** my remixes to credit the original creator and notify collaborators,
**so that** collaboration is encouraged and attribution is preserved.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Extend remix server action to record lineage (original creation ID, creatorId) in `creations` and update `engagement_events` with remix events.  
2. Feed and profile UI display attribution badges (e.g., “Remix of @creator”), linking to the source creation; original creators receive notifications.  
3. Collaboration settings allow original creators to opt in/out of remix notifications and revenue-sharing (placeholder for future payouts).  
4. Observability logs remix volumes, attribution integrity, and anomalies (e.g., missing source).  
5. Tests cover remix lineage recording, UI attribution display, notification delivery, and regression when collaboration toggle disabled.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Lineage tracking (AC: 1)  
  - [ ] Update remix actions to write lineage metadata and events.  
  - [ ] Ensure feed ranking accounts for remix engagement.  
- [ ] UI attribution (AC: 2)  
  - [ ] Display attribution badge on feed cards and creation viewer.  
  - [ ] Link to original creation profile.  
- [ ] Collaboration settings (AC: 3)  
  - [ ] Add profile settings for remix notifications/revenue sharing.  
  - [ ] Respect settings when sending notifications.  
- [ ] Observability (AC: 4)  
  - [ ] Emit metrics (`social.remix.count`, `social.remix.attributionMissing`).  
  - [ ] Configure alerts for anomalies.  
- [ ] Testing (AC: 5)  
  - [ ] Jest tests for remix action & settings.  
  - [ ] Playwright tests for attribution UI.  
  - [ ] Manual regression when remix features disabled.

## Dev Notes
- References: `docs/architecture.md#4-Application-Architecture`, `docs/architecture-brownfield.md#6-Workflows` for remix flows.  
- Ensure feature flag can disable remix enhancements if needed.  
- Collaboration revenue share ties into earnings flow introduced in `docs/architecture.md#5.7` (future work).

## Testing
- Unit + integration tests per testing strategy. `[Source: architecture.md#8-Testing-Strategy]`
