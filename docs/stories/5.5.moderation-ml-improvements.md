# Story 5.5: Moderation ML Training & Continuous Improvement

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** machine learning engineer,
**I want** to retrain moderation models using feedback data,
**so that** automated decisions improve accuracy over time.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Collect labeled datasets from moderation outcomes (approved, rejected, appeal results) and store in a secure dataset for training.  
2. Implement training pipeline (offline job) that updates ML models or heuristics, publishing new versions behind feature flags for gradual rollout.  
3. Provide evaluation metrics (precision, recall, false positive rate) and require thresholds before promoting new models.  
4. Observability monitors model performance post-rollout, compares against control, and alerts on regression.  
5. Documentation outlines training process, data retention policy, and rollback steps; tests validate data collection, pipeline execution, and model serving toggles.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Data collection (AC: 1)  
  - [ ] Aggregate moderation decisions into training datasets (BigQuery or storage).  
  - [ ] Ensure PII removal/anonymization.  
- [ ] Training pipeline (AC: 2)  
  - [ ] Build training scripts/jobs (e.g., Cloud Run batch) producing model artifacts.  
  - [ ] Deploy models behind feature flags for staged rollout.  
- [ ] Evaluation (AC: 3)  
  - [ ] Compute metrics, compare to baselines, require approval before promotion.  
- [ ] Observability (AC: 4)  
  - [ ] Track live metrics vs control; set alerts on regression.  
- [ ] Documentation/tests (AC: 5)  
  - [ ] Document SOP, retention policy, rollback steps.  
  - [ ] Add tests/scripts verifying data pipeline and feature flag toggles.

## Dev Notes
- References: `docs/architecture.md#6-Integration-Architecture`, `docs/architecture.md#7.4-Observability`, compliance section.  
- Ensure GDPR compliance for training data; apply retention limits outlined in Rollback & Compliance strategy.

## Testing
- Automated sanity checks on dataset, training job, and deployment toggles.
