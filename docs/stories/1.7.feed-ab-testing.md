# Story 1.7: Feed Experimentation & A/B Testing

## Status
Ready

## Story
**As a** growth/product analyst on Pod.Style,
**I want** the feed experience to support configurable experiments (e.g., ranking tweaks, UI variants),
**so that** we can evaluate engagement improvements without destabilizing the live experience.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Introduce an experimentation framework within the feed module that can target cohorts (e.g., region/language) and toggle ranking weight parameters or UI treatments via Remote Config/feature flags.  
2. Server actions surface experiment metadata (variant id, parameter overrides) to the client, while default behavior remains unchanged when experiments are off.  
3. Client FeedScreen reads experiment metadata and applies corresponding UI adjustments (e.g., highlight trending badge) only for active variants.  
4. Observability captures experiment assignments, key metrics (feed latency, engagement events) segmented by variant, and ensures dashboards/alerts work with variant breakdown.  
5. Tests verify experiment configuration logic, server/client variant handling, and backwards compatibility when experiments disabled.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Experiment configuration (AC: 1)  
  - [ ] Define experiment config structure (variant IDs, weight multipliers) using Remote Config/env.  
  - [ ] Update feed service to read experiment settings per request (based on user locale/segment).  
- [ ] Server-side variant handling (AC: 2)  
  - [ ] Modify server actions to include experiment metadata in responses (e.g., `variant`, `weightOverrides`).  
  - [ ] Ensure fallback to control variant when experiments disabled.  
- [ ] Client adjustments (AC: 3)  
  - [ ] FeedScreen consumes variant metadata and applies UI cues (e.g., trending badge).  
  - [ ] Provide graceful handling when variant data missing.  
- [ ] Observability (AC: 4)  
  - [ ] Emit metrics segmented by variant (`feed.experiment.variant.{id}`) and log assignments.  
  - [ ] Document dashboards/alerting updates for experiment monitoring.  
- [ ] Testing (AC: 5)  
  - [ ] Jest unit tests for experiment config resolution and service adjustments.  
  - [ ] Playwright integration test verifying variant-specific UI behavior.  
  - [ ] Manual regression ensuring control experience unaffected when experiments off.

## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
- Stories 1.1–1.6 provided feed foundation, ranking, ingestion, real-time refresh, search. Experiments must overlay this infrastructure without regressions.

### Data Models
- Experiment parameters may adjust `rankingSignals` weights; ensure updates only affect selected cohorts and default to control values.  
  `[Source: architecture.md#5-data-architecture]`

### API & Service Specifications
- Feed service should accept experiment overrides for scoring logic while maintaining control behavior.  
  `[Source: architecture.md#4-application-architecture]`
- Observability requires variant-level metrics/logs.  
  `[Source: architecture.md#74-observability]`

### Component Specifications
- UI adjustments minimal (e.g., badges, micro animations) and must be feature-flagged to avoid disrupting control group.  
  `[Source: architecture.md#3-business-user-experience-architecture]`

### File Locations & Project Structure
- Experiment configuration helper in `src/features/feed/experiments.ts` or similar.  
  `[Source: architecture.md#41-components--responsibilities]`
- Client variant consumption in `FeedScreen` (or dedicated component).  
  `[Source: architecture.md#4-application-architecture]`

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for experiment config & scoring adjustments; integration tests for UI variant behavior.  
  `[Source: architecture.md#8-testing-strategy]`

### Technical Constraints
- Feature flags/Remote Config must control experiments; rollback procedure should disable variants instantly.  
  `[Source: architecture-brownfield.md#10-migration--rollout-strategy]`
- Ensure privacy compliance (no logging of personally identifiable segmentation data).  
  `[Source: architecture.md#74-observability]`

## Testing
- Jest unit tests for experiment resolution. `[Source: architecture.md#8-testing-strategy]`
- Playwright integration test verifying UI variant behavior. `[Source: architecture.md#8-testing-strategy]`
- Manual regression ensuring control experience unaffected. `[Source: architecture.md#7.3-Deployment-Strategy]`

#### Code Quality Assessment
- 锚点仍为原始标题写法，文档尚在 Draft 状态。

#### Test Strategy & Coverage
- 未涉及代码变更，暂不评估。

#### NFR Assessment
- Not assessed。

#### Issues
1. 调整以下引用：
   - `architecture.md#5-data-architecture` → `architecture.md#5-data-architecture`
   - `architecture.md#4-application-architecture` → `architecture.md#4-application-architecture`
   - `architecture.md#74-observability` → `architecture.md#74-observability`

   - `architecture.md#41-components--responsibilities` → `architecture.md#41-components--responsibilities`
   - `architecture.md#4-application-architecture` (保持 slug 一致)
   - `architecture.md#8-testing-strategy` (保持现状)
   - `architecture-brownfield.md#10-migration--rollout-strategy` → `architecture-brownfield.md#10-migration--rollout-strategy`
2. `Status` 需切换为 `Ready`。`docs/stories/1.7.feed-ab-testing.md:4`
