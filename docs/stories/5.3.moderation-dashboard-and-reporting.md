# Story 5.3: Moderation Dashboard & Reporting

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** moderation lead,
**I want** dashboards and reports that track moderation backlog, outcomes, and reviewer performance,
**so that** we can maintain quality and meet SLAs.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Build a moderation dashboard (Looker Studio or equivalent) pulling data from `moderation_flags`, `moderation_tasks`, and audit logs, showing backlog, resolution times, false positives, and appeals outcomes.  
2. Provide weekly/monthly reports (exportable) summarizing moderation metrics by category, reviewer, and region, highlighting SLA adherence.  
3. Integrate alerts for backlog thresholds, API failure spikes, and repeated false positives to notify moderation team.  
4. Ensure data privacy: dashboards restrict access to authorized roles and anonymize reporter/appeal identifiers where needed.  
5. Tests/verification include data accuracy checks, dashboard refresh validation, and alert simulation.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Dashboard creation (AC: 1)  
  - [ ] Set up dashboard with key KPIs and drilldowns.  
  - [ ] Confirm data refresh frequency and access controls.  
- [ ] Reporting exports (AC: 2)  
  - [ ] Create export scripts/queries for weekly/monthly summaries.  
  - [ ] Document distribution process.  
- [ ] Alerts (AC: 3)  
  - [ ] Configure alerts for backlog thresholds, false positives.  
  - [ ] Test alert triggers.  
- [ ] Privacy controls (AC: 4)  
  - [ ] Enforce role-based access; anonymize sensitive fields.  
- [ ] Verification (AC: 5)  
  - [ ] Manual spot checks of dashboard data vs raw sources.  
  - [ ] Simulate alerts; validate export accuracy.
