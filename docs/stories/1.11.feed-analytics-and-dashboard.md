# Story 1.11: Feed Analytics & Dashboard

## Status
Ready

## Story
**As a** product analyst,
**I want** a feed analytics dashboard tracking key metrics (latency, engagement, ranking signals),
**so that** stakeholders can monitor performance, diagnose issues, and evaluate experiments.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Instrumented metrics (latency, cache hit rate, ranking score distribution, refresh frequency, interaction counts) are exported to the analytics pipeline (e.g., BigQuery/Cloud Logging) with variant segmentation.  
2. Dashboards (Looker Studio or equivalent) visualize feed KPIs (DAU, scroll depth, engagement per variant, moderation impacts) using existing analytics infrastructure.  
3. Alerting rules trigger notifications when metrics exceed thresholds (e.g., feed latency spikes, cache miss rate high, moderation backlog).  
4. Documentation provides instructions for analysts to query data (SQL samples) and interpret dashboard widgets, ensuring alignment with story 1.7 experiments.  
5. Tests / verification steps: metric instrumentation validation, dashboard data accuracy (spot checks), and alert trigger simulations.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Metric instrumentation (AC: 1)  
  - [ ] Ensure existing logging emits metrics with variant labels (utilize `feed.*` namespaces).  
  - [ ] Configure exports to BigQuery/GA/Cloud Logging as per architecture.  
- [ ] Dashboard creation (AC: 2)  
  - [ ] Build or update analytics dashboard with feed KPIs, variant segments, moderation data.  
  - [ ] Verify data refresh cadence and access controls.  
- [ ] Alerts (AC: 3)  
  - [ ] Define thresholds + notifications for latency, cache miss, notification failures, moderation backlog.  
  - [ ] Test alert triggers via emulation.  
- [ ] Documentation (AC: 4)  
  - [ ] Write analyst guide (SQL snippets, dashboard definitions, experiment interpretation).  
  - [ ] Document in docs/analytics or operations handbook.  
- [ ] Verification (AC: 5)  
  - [ ] Validate metrics appear in BigQuery/GA.  
  - [ ] Perform manual spot checks comparing raw data and dashboard.  
  - [ ] Simulate alert triggers and verify notifications.

## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
- Stories 1.1–1.10 established feed, ranking, experiments, interactions. Analytics ties these together for monitoring and optimization.

### Data Models & Pipelines
- Use analytics pipeline described (BigQuery export, Cloud Logging) to store metrics.  
  `[Source: architecture.md#74-observability]`
- Dashboards should track `feed.service.latency`, `feed.refresh.frequency`, `feed.ranking.scoreDistribution`, `feed.interaction.count`, etc.  
  `[Source: architecture.md#74-observability]`

### Component Specifications
- No UI change; dashboards built with analytics tooling. Ensure access controls for analysts.  
  `[Source: architecture-brownfield.md#12-handoffs]`

### File Locations & Project Structure
- Documentation under `docs/analytics` or similar; scripts in `scripts/analytics`.  
  `[Source: architecture.md#41-components--responsibilities]`

### Testing Requirements
- Manual validation plus scripted sanity checks for metrics/dashboards; align with testing strategy.  
  `[Source: architecture.md#8-testing-strategy]`

### Technical Constraints
- Metrics should not capture PII; aggregator must maintain privacy.  
  `[Source: architecture.md#74-observability]`
- Ensure compatibility with experiments (variant segmentation).  
  `[Source: architecture.md#72-infrastructure-changes]`

## Testing
- Manual and scripted verification of dashboard/metrics. `[Source: architecture.md#8-testing-strategy]`
