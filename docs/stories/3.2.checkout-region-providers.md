# Story 3.2: Regional Payment Providers & Fallbacks

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** buyer in different regions (US/EU/Middle East),
**I want** checkout to offer region-appropriate payment options (Stripe, PayPal, Klarna, Tabby),
**so that** I can pay with familiar methods without friction.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Extend `payments-service` to support region-specific providers: Stripe (global), PayPal (global), Klarna (EU), Tabby (Middle East), selectable based on user locale/region configuration.  
2. Checkout UI displays available payment options dynamically, with logic to fall back to Stripe when regional provider unavailable.  
3. Payment intents/tokenization stored in `payments` collection include provider metadata and status to support reconciliation and refunds.  
4. Observability captures provider usage, failure rates, and fallback occurrences; dashboards track payment success by provider/region.  
5. Tests cover provider selection logic, fallback paths, payment confirmation flows, and regression against guest/auth checkouts.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Provider configuration (AC: 1)  
  - [ ] Update config to map regions to providers/priority order.  
  - [ ] Implement provider modules in `payments-service`.  
- [ ] UI option rendering (AC: 2)  
  - [ ] Adjust checkout UI to list provider-specific buttons/forms.  
  - [ ] Handle fallback gracefully (e.g., message when provider disabled).  
- [ ] Payment metadata (AC: 3)  
  - [ ] Store provider info in `payments` documents, ensure reconcilable data.  
  - [ ] Provide utilities for refunds/capture differences.  
- [ ] Observability (AC: 4)  
  - [ ] Emit metrics (`checkout.provider.{name}.success/failure`).  
  - [ ] Update dashboards/alerts for provider outages.  
- [ ] Testing (AC: 5)  
  - [ ] Jest tests for provider selection/fallback.  
  - [ ] Playwright tests verifying checkout flow per region.  
  - [ ] Manual regression with mock providers.

## Dev Notes
### Data Models
- `payments` collection must capture provider type, token IDs, status history.  
  `[Source: architecture.md#5-Data-Architecture]`

### API & Service Specs
- Payment service architecture describes provider adapters.  
  `[Source: architecture.md#6-Integration-Architecture]`
- Ensure each provider integration adheres to compliance and security requirements.  
  `[Source: prd.md#5.4-Commerce-&-Fulfillment]`

### Component Specs
- UI should clearly indicate provider selection and fallback.  
  `[Source: architecture.md#3-Business-User-Experience-Architecture]`

### File Locations & Project Structure
- Provider modules under `src/features/payments/server/providers/`.  
  `[Source: architecture.md#4.1-Components-&-Responsibilities]`
- UI adjustments in checkout screen components.  
  `[Source: architecture.md#4-Application-Architecture]`

### Testing Requirements
- Unit + integration tests for provider interactions.  
  `[Source: architecture.md#8-Testing-Strategy]`

### Technical Constraints
- Feature flags to enable providers per region; ensure quick rollback.  
  `[Source: architecture-brownfield.md#10-Migration-&-Rollout-Strategy]`
- Security: store only tokenized data.  
  `[Source: architecture.md#9-Security-Integration]`

## Testing
- Jest tests for provider selection logic. `[Source: architecture.md#8-Testing-Strategy]`
- Playwright tests for region-based checkout flows. `[Source: architecture.md#8-Testing-Strategy]`
