# Story 4.6: Creator Profile Enhancements & Social Growth Tools

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** creator building an audience,
**I want** enhanced profile pages with social metrics and shareable links,
**so that** new followers can discover my work and I can track growth.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Redesign creator profile page to highlight bio, social links, follower/following counts, and featured creations (pinned/most popular).  
2. Provide growth analytics widget showing follower trends, top referrers, and engagement metrics (leveraging `engagement_events`).  
3. Add shareable profile link with OG metadata, optional QR code, and integration with external social channels.  
4. Observability tracks profile visits, share link usage, and growth metrics; dashboards visualize creator growth funnels.  
5. Tests cover profile UI, analytics data accuracy, share link functionality, and regression when social features disabled.
